	 <div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</div>
						
							<p>
							 Our universe is defined as totality of existence including
      						 planets stars galaxies.it is simply everything and is limited
      						 to what can be observed by our eye.over the centuries more precise 
      						 observations and improved theories of gravity led to copernicus heliocentric 
      						 model  of solar system.further improvements in astronomy led to
      						 fact that solar syatem is embedded in galaxy composed of billion of stars.  
      						 Scientists believe that the Solar System evolved from a giant cloud of dust and gas. 
      						 They believe that this dust and gas began to collapse under the weight of its own gravity. 
      
							</p>
							<p>
							As it did so, the matter contained within this could begin moving in a giant circle, much 
     						 like the water in a drain moves around the center of the drain in a circle.
       						 At the center of this spinning cloud, a small star began to form. 
       						 This star grew larger and larger as it collected more and more of 
     						  the dust and gas that collapsed into it.The size of universe is unknown.
      						  it may be infinite.the region visible from
  	  						  earth is a sphere of radius of about 46 billion light years.considering only
  	  						  the largest structures the universe is made up of filaments,voids,superclusters
  	  						  galaxy groups and clusters.
							  </p>
							  <p>
							   Ever since cosmologists started to trace events backward in time based on the
      						   Big Bang model, their views, which focused only on the very large, got smaller
      						   and smaller. They knew, that by extrapolating backward, they would be led into 
     						    a universe that was very hot, very dense, very tiny, and governed by extremely
     							 high energies.These conditions were definitely within the realm of particle 
								 physics, or the study of the very small.
